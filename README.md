# Turing Machine Emulator
Brice Brosig

## Description

This program emulates a turing machine similar to the brainfuck programming language. It supports the following commands:

* move read/write head forward or backward
* increment cell at read/write head
* while loop conditioned by the value at the head
* put a value in a cell
* print a value from a cell

It was an assignment for my programming languages class at university.

## running the program

To run use the latest python version. In your terminal, in the directory where the python script is, run "python3 main.py".
